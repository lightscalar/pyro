# PYRO — A lightweight framework for quick web APIs in Flask


## Introduction

PYRO is a *highly* opinionated framework for building quick Web APIs using
Flask.

## Requirements

We require `flask`, `inflect`, `pymongo`.

## Models

The Model is the core


```python
class User(Model):
    pass
```

And that's it. Now you can create an instance of a user by passing in a 
dictionary object to the `new` method.

And are back to normal here?
